## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) <br>
**Since I do not have much experience with frontend development, I enjoyed learning the basics by applying it to a fun game. The biggest challenge was definitely writing the guess function, since I am still not familiar with the syntax yet. To overcome it, I watched a video on the basic concepts of JavaScript and went over the given code to make sure I was doing it correctly.**<br>

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)<br>
**1. What is the most efficient way to debug code when it comes to web development?**<br>
**2. How do you know what language is best at handling a particular aspect of the website?**<br>
**3. What differentiates a good website from a great one?**<br>

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) <br>
**If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would like to stylise the page differently since I quite enjoyed using CSS to do so. Further, I would make the game faster so as to challenge the player more, add a timer to make it more fun, and randomise the pattern, so as to make it less predictable.**<br>
